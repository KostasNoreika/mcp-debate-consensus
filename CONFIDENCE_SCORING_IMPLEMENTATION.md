# Task 006: Confidence Scoring System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive confidence scoring system for the AI Expert Consensus debate framework. This system provides users with clear, actionable insights about when to trust AI consensus outputs.

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Confidence Calculation Engine (`src/confidence-scorer.js`)
- **Multi-factor scoring**: Combines 4 weighted factors for comprehensive assessment
- **Semantic similarity analysis**: Advanced text comparison for model agreement measurement
- **Historical learning**: Tracks accuracy patterns by question category
- **Consistency checking**: Detects contradictions and measures approach alignment

#### 2. Scoring Factors & Weights
- **Model Agreement (40%)**: Semantic similarity between AI responses
- **Verification Status (30%)**: Integration with cross-verification results
- **Historical Accuracy (20%)**: Category-based performance tracking
- **Response Consistency (10%)**: Contradiction detection and approach alignment

#### 3. Confidence Thresholds
```
> 90%  - Very High Confidence: Safe to implement with minimal review
75-90% - High Confidence: Standard implementation with normal review
60-75% - Moderate Confidence: Careful implementation with thorough review
40-60% - Low Confidence: Manual verification required, expert review
< 40%  - Very Low Confidence: Do not implement without expert review
```

#### 4. MCP Integration
- **New tool**: `confidence_analysis` exposed via MCP protocol
- **Flexible input**: Analyze completed debates by ID or provide raw data
- **Rich output**: Detailed confidence reports with factors, analysis, and recommendations

#### 5. Automatic Integration
- **Embedded in debates**: All new debates automatically include confidence scoring
- **Phase 4**: Added as final step in debate process after synthesis
- **Logged results**: Confidence data stored in debate logs for historical analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### Confidence Calculation Algorithm

```javascript
const factors = {
  consensus: calculateConsensus(responses),      // 40% weight
  verification: verificationScore,               // 30% weight
  historical: getHistoricalAccuracy(category),  // 20% weight
  consistency: checkConsistency(responses)       // 10% weight
};

confidence = weightedAverage(factors, weights);
```

### Semantic Similarity Engine
- **Concept extraction**: Identifies technical terms and patterns
- **Structural analysis**: Compares response organization and format
- **Contradiction detection**: Identifies conflicting recommendations
- **Approach consistency**: Measures technical methodology alignment

### Historical Learning System
- **Category mapping**: Maps questions to expertise domains
- **Accuracy tracking**: Records success/failure rates by category
- **Confidence correlation**: Learns which confidence levels predict success
- **Data persistence**: Stores learning data in `logs/confidence-history.json`

## Usage Examples

### 1. Automatic Confidence in Debates
```bash
# Confidence automatically calculated for all debates
npm run debate "How to implement authentication?"
# Output includes: Confidence: 87% (High Confidence)
```

### 2. Standalone Confidence Analysis
```javascript
// Via MCP tool
{
  "tool": "confidence_analysis",
  "arguments": {
    "question": "Architecture question",
    "proposals": {
      "model1": "response1",
      "model2": "response2"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Historical Debate Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze past debate
{
  "tool": "confidence_analysis",
  "arguments": {
    "historyId": "debate_12345"
  }
}
```

## Output Format
