## üîß Usage

### Basic Usage

The learning system runs automatically with every debate. No special configuration is required.

```javascript
import { ClaudeCliDebate } from './src/claude-cli-debate.js';

const debate = new ClaudeCliDebate();

// Learning happens automatically
const result = await debate.runDebate('How to implement binary search?');

// The system learns from this debate and improves future selections
```

### Manual Optimization

You can also request specific optimizations:

```javascript
import { LearningSystem } from './src/learning/learning-system.js';

const learningSystem = new LearningSystem();
await learningSystem.initialize();

// Get optimal model selection for a category
const optimization = await learningSystem.getOptimalSelection(
  'Debug a Node.js memory leak',
  {
    category: 'tech/debug',
    urgency: 0.8,        // High urgency
    budgetConstraint: 0.7, // Strict budget
    quality: 0.6,        // Moderate quality requirements
    maxModels: 2         // Only 2 models
  }
);

console.log('Recommended models:', optimization.models.map(m => m.id));
console.log('Expected cost reduction:', optimization.metrics.costReduction + '%');
```

### Analytics and Reporting

```bash
# Get current learning status
npm run learning:status

# Generate comprehensive report
npm run learning:report

# Test the learning system
npm run learning:test

# Reset learning data (for testing)
npm run learning:reset
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Disable learning system
DISABLE_LEARNING=true

# Configure learning intervals
LEARNING_PATTERN_INTERVAL=20    # Run pattern detection every 20 debates
LEARNING_REPORT_INTERVAL=50     # Generate reports every 50 debates

# Learning system data retention
LEARNING_MAX_HISTORY_DAYS=365   # Keep data for 1 year
```

### Learning System Settings

The system automatically adjusts these parameters based on available data:

- **Minimum debates for optimization**: 10
- **Cost optimization threshold**: 50 debates
- **Pattern detection confidence**: 70%
- **Auto-optimization trigger**: 50 debates

## üìÅ Data Storage

Learning data is stored in `/data/` directory:

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model-profiles.json       # Individual model performance profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detected-patterns.json    # Identified patterns and trends
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ optimization-rules.json   # Learned optimization rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ learning-stats.json       # System statistics

Models that consistently underperform in specific categories
- **Example**: k1 (Claude Opus) struggling with speed-critical debugging
- **Action**: Reduces selection probability for time-sensitive tasks

### Emerging Trends
Performance changes over time
- **Example**: k3 (Qwen 3 Max) improving in creative writing tasks
- **Action**: Updates model strengths and selection algorithms

### Model Synergies
Combinations that work particularly well together
- **Example**: k1 + k3 producing higher quality solutions
- **Action**: Preferences these combinations for important tasks

## üéØ Performance Benefits

### Cost Reduction Examples

**Before Learning** (using k1 for everything):
- Tech debugging: k1 + k2 + k3 = Cost: 2.0, Time: 90s
- Math calculation: k1 + k2 + k3 = Cost: 2.0, Time: 85s

**After Learning** (optimized selection):
- Tech debugging: k5 + k2 = Cost: 0.8 (-60%), Time: 40s (-56%)
