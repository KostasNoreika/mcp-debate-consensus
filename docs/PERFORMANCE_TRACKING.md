## What to Do With This Data

### 1. Model Selection Optimization
```javascript
// After 100+ debates, we can predict best models per category
const modelSelector = {
  getOptimalModels(category, urgency = 'normal') {
    const stats = await db.getModelPerformance(category);

    if (urgency === 'fast') {
      // Prioritize k5 (Grok) for speed
      return stats.filter(m => m.avgTime < 5).slice(0, 3);
    }

    if (urgency === 'critical') {
      // Use all 5 for maximum accuracy
      return ['k1', 'k2', 'k3', 'k4', 'k5'];
    }

    // Normal: Top 3 performers for this category
    return stats
      .sort((a, b) => b.avgScore - a.avgScore)
      .slice(0, 3)
      .map(m => m.model);
  }
};
```

### 2. Cost Optimization
```javascript
// Reduce costs by using fewer models when confidence is high
const costOptimizer = {
  async shouldAddMoreModels(currentResults, category) {
    const variance = calculateVariance(currentResults);
    const historicalAccuracy = await getHistoricalAccuracy(category);

    if (variance < 0.1 && historicalAccuracy > 0.9) {
      return false; // High agreement, good history = no need for more
    }
    return true;
  }
};
```

### 3. Continuous Learning
```javascript
// Update model weights based on performance
const learningSystem = {
  async updateWeights(debateResult) {
    const { category, winner, scores } = debateResult;

    // Increase weight for winner in this category
    await db.incrementWeight(category, winner, 0.1);

    // Slightly decrease weight for lowest performer
    const loser = Object.entries(scores)
      .sort(([,a], [,b]) => a - b)[0][0];
    await db.decrementWeight(category, loser, 0.05);
  }
};
```

### 4. Automatic Category Detection
```javascript
// Use embeddings to auto-categorize questions
const categoryDetector = {
  async detectCategory(question) {
    // Use a small LLM to classify
    const embedding = await getEmbedding(question);
    const similarities = await compareToKnownCategories(embedding);

    return {
      primary: similarities[0].category,
      secondary: similarities.slice(1, 3).map(s => s.category),
      confidence: similarities[0].score
    };
  }
};
```
