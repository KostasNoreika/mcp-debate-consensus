# Cross-Verification System Design

## Current Debate vs Cross-Verification

### What We Have Now (Debate):
1. **Round 1**: Each model provides independent solution
2. **Selection**: Best solution chosen by scoring
3. **Round 2**: Other models suggest improvements
4. **Synthesis**: Combine into final solution

### What Cross-Verification Adds:
**Fact-checking and error detection layer** where models actively look for mistakes in each other's work.

## Cross-Verification Implementation

### Level 1: Basic Fact Checking
```javascript
class CrossVerification {
  async verifyFacts(originalResponse, model) {
    // Each model explicitly checks facts from other models
    const verificationPrompt = `
      Review this response for factual errors, incorrect assumptions, or logical flaws:

      ${originalResponse}

      Specifically check:
      1. Are all technical facts correct?
      2. Are API/library usages accurate?
      3. Are there any security vulnerabilities?
      4. Are performance claims realistic?
      5. Are there edge cases not considered?

      List any errors found with corrections.
    `;

    return await this.callModel(model, verificationPrompt);
  }
}
```

### Level 2: Code Execution Verification
```javascript
class ExecutionVerification {
  async verifyCode(proposedCode, testCases) {
    // Actually run the code to verify it works
    const results = [];

    for (const model of this.models) {
      const verification = await this.callModel(model, `
        Test this code with these test cases:

        CODE:
        ${proposedCode}

        TEST CASES:
        ${JSON.stringify(testCases)}

        Run the code and report:
        1. Does it compile/run?
        2. Do all test cases pass?
        3. Any runtime errors?
        4. Performance metrics?
      `);

      results.push({
        model: model.name,
        verification,
        passed: this.extractTestResults(verification)
      });
    }

    return this.consensusOnCorrectness(results);
  }
}
```

### Level 3: Adversarial Verification
```javascript
class AdversarialVerification {
  async challengeSolution(solution, originalQuestion) {
    // Models actively try to break each other's solutions
    const challenges = [];

    // k2 (GPT-5) tries to find bugs
    challenges.push(this.callModel('k2', `
      Your role: Find bugs and edge cases in this solution.
      Try to break it. What inputs would cause failures?

      Solution: ${solution}
    `));

    // k4 (Gemini) checks completeness
    challenges.push(this.callModel('k4', `
      Your role: Find missing requirements.
      What did the solution forget to handle?

      Original request: ${originalQuestion}
      Solution: ${solution}
    `));

    // k5 (Grok) rapid stress test
    challenges.push(this.callModel('k5', `
      Your role: Quick stress test.
      What happens under extreme conditions?
      List potential failure modes.

      Solution: ${solution}
    `));

    return await Promise.all(challenges);
  }
}
```

## Integration with Current System

### Enhanced Debate Flow:
```javascript
class EnhancedDebate {
  async runWithCrossVerification(question, projectPath) {
    // 1. Normal Round 1: Get proposals
    const proposals = await this.getProposals(question, projectPath);

    // 2. NEW: Cross-verify all proposals
    const verificationResults = await this.crossVerifyAll(proposals);

    // 3. Select best WITH verification scores
    const best = await this.selectBest(proposals, verificationResults);

    // 4. Normal Round 2: Improvements
    const improvements = await this.getImprovements(best, question);

    // 5. NEW: Adversarial challenge
    const challenges = await this.adversarialChallenge(best);

    // 6. Final synthesis including challenge responses
    const final = await this.synthesizeWithChallenges(
      best,
      improvements,
      challenges
    );

    // 7. NEW: Final verification pass
    const finalVerification = await this.finalVerify(final);

    return {
      solution: final,
      verificationScore: finalVerification.score,
      challengesPassed: finalVerification.passed,
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(finalVerification)
    };
  }

  async crossVerifyAll(proposals) {
    const verifications = {};

    for (const [author, proposal] of Object.entries(proposals)) {
      verifications[author] = [];

      // Each other model verifies this proposal
      for (const verifier of this.models) {
        if (verifier.name !== author) {
          const result = await this.verifyProposal(
            proposal,
            verifier,
            author
          );
          verifications[author].push(result);
        }
      }
    }

    return verifications;
  }
}
```

## Difference from Current Debate

### Current Debate:
- **Collaborative**: Models build on each other
- **Constructive**: Focus on improvements
- **Synthesis**: Combine best parts

### With Cross-Verification:
- **Adversarial**: Models challenge each other
- **Critical**: Focus on finding flaws
- **Validation**: Prove correctness
- **Confidence scores**: Measurable trust level

## When to Use Cross-Verification

### Always Use For:
1. **Security-critical code** - Authentication, encryption
2. **Financial calculations** - Payment processing, trading
3. **Data migrations** - Database schema changes
4. **Production deployments** - Infrastructure changes
5. **Regulatory compliance** - GDPR, HIPAA, PCI

### Optional For:
1. **UI/UX changes** - Subjective, less critical
2. **Documentation** - Low risk
3. **Prototypes** - Speed over perfection
4. **Internal tools** - Limited impact

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Basic Verification (Easy)
- Add fact-checking round after proposals
- Simple boolean "verified/not verified"

### Phase 2: Execution Verification (Medium)
- Run proposed code in sandboxes
- Automated test execution

### Phase 3: Adversarial System (Complex)
- Models actively try to break solutions
- Formal verification methods
- Confidence scoring

## Example Output

```javascript
{
  "solution": "Final implemented solution...",
  "verification": {
    "factual_accuracy": 0.95,
    "code_correctness": 1.0,
    "security_verified": true,
    "edge_cases_handled": 0.90,
    "challenges_passed": 4,
    "challenges_total": 5,
    "confidence": 0.92
  },
  "warnings": [
    "k2: Potential performance issue with large datasets",
    "k4: Missing error handling for network timeouts"
  ],
  "consensus": "High confidence solution with minor improvements suggested"
}
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits:
- **Higher reliability** - Catch errors before production
- **Measurable confidence** - Know when to trust output
- **Learning data** - Track which models catch which errors

### Costs:
- **2-3x more tokens** - Each verification pass costs
- **50% more time** - Additional rounds needed
- **Complexity** - More moving parts

### Recommendation:
Implement as **optional mode** activated by:
- User request: "verify this thoroughly"
- Category detection: security/financial = auto-verify
- Criticality flag: `--verify=strict`
