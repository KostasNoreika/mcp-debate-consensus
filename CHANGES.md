# Changes Made to Debate Consensus System

## Date: 2025-09-15

### Problem Report
Client reported that GPT-5 (k2) was returning HTTP 400 errors while other models (k1, k3, k4) were working. System needed to:
1. Fix GPT-5 model name issue
2. Increase token limits for better responses
3. Ensure system resilience when some models fail

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Fixed GPT-5 Model Name
**Issue**: Model was configured as `openai/gpt-5` but should be `openai/gpt-5-chat`

**Files Modified**:
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/k-proxy-server.js` (line 35)
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/claude-router/proxy.js` (line 23)
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/health-check.js` (line 282, 311)

**Change**:
```javascript
// Before
'k2': 'openai/gpt-5'
// After
'k2': 'openai/gpt-5-chat'
```

#### 2. Implemented Dynamic Token Limits
**Issue**: All models were using a hardcoded 4096 tokens, which is too limiting

**Files Modified**:
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/k-proxy-server.js` (lines 40-46, 74)
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/claude-router/proxy.js` (lines 28-34, 78)

**Token Limits Set** (Conservative values for cost-effectiveness):
```javascript
const maxTokensMap = {
  'k1': 16000,   // Claude Opus 4.1 (max capability: 32k)
  'k2': 32000,   // GPT-5-chat (max capability: 128k!)
  'k3': 16000,   // Qwen 3 Max (max capability: 32.768k)
  'k4': 32000    // Gemini 2.5 Pro (max capability: 66k)
};
```

#### 3. Added Proper Health Check Endpoints
**Issue**: Health checks needed minimum 20 tokens (was using 1 token)

**Files Modified**:
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/k-proxy-server.js` (added `/health/test` endpoint)
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/claude-router/proxy.js` (added `/health/test` endpoint)
- `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/health-check.js` (lines 312, 356)

**New Health Check Features**:
- `GET /health` - Simple status check (no API call)
- `POST /health/test` - Deep health check with 20 token minimum
- Tests actual model connectivity
- 10-second timeout for quick response

#### 4. System Resilience Verification
**Verified**: The system already implements proper resilience:
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` to wait for ALL models to respond or fail
- Only requires minimum 2 models AFTER all have completed
- Does NOT stop early when 2 models respond
- Continues with partial results (2-3 models) if some fail

**File**: `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/src/claude-cli-debate.js`
- Line 316: Waits for all models with `Promise.allSettled()`
- Line 105-108: Checks minimum 2 models after all complete

#### 5. Created Test Script
**New File**: `/opt/mcp/servers/debate-consensus/test-model-resilience.sh`

**Features**:
- Checks proxy server status for all models
- Tests model health with proper token limits
- Verifies configuration changes
- Reports system readiness
- Color-coded output for easy reading

### Technical Details

#### Maximum Token Capabilities (from research):
- **Claude Opus 4.1**: 32,000 output tokens
- **GPT-5-chat**: 128,000 output tokens (!)
- **Qwen 3 Max**: 32,768 output tokens
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 66,000 output tokens

#### Context Windows:
- **GPT-5**: 400,000 total (272,000 input + 128,000 output)
- **Qwen 3 Max**: 262,144 total
- **Claude Opus 4.1**: ~200,000 total
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Variable, very large

### Testing
Run the test script to verify all changes:
```bash
./test-model-resilience.sh
```

Or run the health check:
```bash
node health-check.js
```

### Result
The debate consensus system now:
- ✅ Works correctly with GPT-5-chat
- ✅ Uses optimal token limits for each model
- ✅ Continues operating even if 1-2 models fail
- ✅ Has proper health checks with 20+ token minimums
- ✅ Provides better, longer responses from all models
