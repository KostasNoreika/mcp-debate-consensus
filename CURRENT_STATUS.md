# Debate Consensus MCP Server - Current Status

## What Works ✅

### k1-k4 Aliases (Pure LLM via OpenRouter)
- **k1** → Claude (Anthropic) 
- **k2** → GPT-4o mini (OpenAI)
- **k3** → Qwen (Alibaba)
- **k4** → Gemini (Google)

These work as simple command-line LLMs through the wrapper script:
- ✅ Different models respond with their unique identities
- ✅ Can answer questions and generate code
- ✅ Can run in parallel
- ❌ NO file system access
- ❌ NO MCP tools support

### c1-c4 Aliases (Full Claude CLI with MCP)
- **c1, c2, c3, c4** → All use Claude Opus with full MCP
- ✅ File creation and editing
- ✅ Code execution
- ✅ All MCP tools
- ❌ All use the same model (Claude Opus)

## Architecture Options

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach (Current)
- Use k1-k4 for theoretical discussions/code generation
- Use c1-c4 when file access is needed
- Suitable for questions that don't require file operations

### Option 2: Proxy Server (Attempted, Complex)
- Would translate between Claude CLI and OpenRouter
- Very complex to implement correctly
- Would need to handle streaming, MCP protocol, etc.

### Option 3: Pure Simulation
- k1-k4 generate solutions as text
- A coordinator script executes the proposed code
- Simpler but less interactive

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test model identities
./test-model-identity.sh

# Test file creation (will fail for k1-k4)
./test-file-creation.sh  

# Test parallel execution
./test-debate-with-progress.js

# Test complex math
node test-complex-math.js
```

## Recommendation

For the debate consensus system:
1. **Use k1-k4 for multi-model perspectives** on theoretical questions
2. **Use c1 as the final arbitrator** with file access to implement the consensus
3. **Accept that k1-k4 are pure LLMs** without file system access

This is actually a good architecture because:
- Different models provide diverse perspectives
- Only the final implementation needs file access
- Parallel execution works well for the debate phase
