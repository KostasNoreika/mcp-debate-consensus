# CLAUDE.md - AI Expert Consensus v2.1 üèÜ ENTERPRISE PRODUCTION READY

**üéâ MASSIVE ACHIEVEMENT: 96% Test Reliability Improvement (279/283 tests passing)**

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the AI Expert Consensus MCP server codebase. The system has achieved enterprise-grade stability with comprehensive testing, security, and monitoring capabilities.

## üõë CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE üõë

1. **NEVER CHANGE MODEL CONFIGURATIONS**: The k1-k5 model aliases are FIXED and must NEVER be changed unless explicitly requested:
   - k1: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` - Architecture and system design
   - k2: `openai/gpt-5` - Testing strategies and debugging
   - k3: `qwen/qwen3-max` - Algorithm optimization
   - k4: `google/gemini-2.5-pro` - Integration and completeness
   - k5: `x-ai/grok-4-fast:free` - Fast reasoning and coding
   - k7: `deepseek/r1` - Deep analytical reasoning
   - k8: `z-ai/glm-4.5` - Chinese AI perspective

2. **DO NOT suggest model alternatives** - these models were specifically chosen by the user.

3. **If models return 404 errors**, fix the naming/format but NEVER switch to a different model.

## Commands

### Essential Setup & Running
```bash
# Initial setup (one-time)
node install.js                # Automated setup script
cp .env.example .env           # Create config (add OPENROUTER_API_KEY)

# Start services (REQUIRED before use)
node k-proxy-server.js &       # Start proxy server on ports 3457-3464
npm start                      # Start MCP server

# Health check
node health-check.js           # Verify system is ready
```

npm run clean             # Clean logs, cache, coverage
```

## Architecture

### Core System Flow

1. **MCP Request Entry** (`index.js`)
   - Receives debate tool calls via MCP protocol
   - Auto-starts k-proxy-server if not running
   - Routes to appropriate debate orchestrator

2. **Proxy Layer** (`k-proxy-server.js`)
   - Runs on ports 3457-3464 for k1-k8 models
   - Translates Claude CLI calls to OpenRouter API
   - Handles authentication and timeout (60 min default)

3. **Debate Orchestration** (`src/claude-cli-debate.js`)
   - **Intelligent Selection**: GeminiCoordinator analyzes question ‚Üí selects 3-5 optimal models
   - **Parallel Execution**: Spawns Claude CLI processes for each model
   - **Full MCP Access**: Each model can read files, run bash, search code
   - **Two-Round Process**: Independent analysis ‚Üí collaborative improvement

4. **Advanced Features**
   - **Security Layer** (`src/security.js`): HMAC-SHA256 signing, rate limiting, input validation
   - **Retry Handler** (`src/utils/retry-handler.js`): Exponential backoff with intelligent error classification
   - **Confidence Scoring** (`src/confidence-scorer.js`): 0-100% scores with multi-factor analysis
   - **Smart Caching** (`src/cache/debate-cache.js`): 90% cost reduction, intelligent invalidation
   - **Learning System** (`src/learning/learning-system.js`): Pattern detection, model profiling
   - **Performance Tracking** (`src/performance-tracker.js`): SQLite-based metrics
   - **Cross-Verification** (`src/cross-verifier.js`): Adversarial testing for critical scenarios
   - **Telemetry** (`src/telemetry-client.js`): Anonymous usage stats (opt-out: TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true)

### Key Directories

- `/src/streaming/` - Real-time progress streaming components
- `/src/learning/` - ML-based optimization and pattern detection
- `/src/verification/` - Adversarial testing and fact-checking
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions including retry handler
- `/data/` - SQLite DB and learning system data
- `/cache/` - Debate cache storage
- `/logs/` - Detailed execution logs
- `/tests/unit/` - Unit tests for all components
- `/tests/integration/` - Integration and end-to-end tests
- `/docs/` - Additional documentation (RETRY_HANDLER.md, etc.)

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# === REQUIRED ===
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxx  # REQUIRED - Get from openrouter.ai

# === SECURITY (Production Recommended) ===
HMAC_SECRET=your_64_char_secret_here      # Generate with: npm run security:generate-secret
ENABLE_REQUEST_SIGNING=true               # Enable HMAC request signing
SIGNATURE_VALIDITY_WINDOW=300             # Request validity window (5 minutes)

# === RETRY CONFIGURATION ===
MAX_RETRIES=3                             # Maximum retry attempts
INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY=1000                  # Initial delay (1 second)
MAX_RETRY_DELAY=30000                     # Maximum delay (30 seconds)
BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER=2                      # Exponential backoff multiplier

# === OPTIONAL ===
DEBATE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=60                 # Request timeout (default: 60)
TELEMETRY_DISABLED=false                  # Opt-out of anonymous telemetry
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10                # Rate limit per minute
```

### MCP Registration
The server must be registered in `~/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "debate-consensus": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-debate-consensus/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Model Testing Workflow

When testing model availability:
1. First run `node health-check.js` to verify proxy servers
2. Check individual model health: `curl http://localhost:3457/health`
3. Test with simple question: `node test-debate.js "What is 2+2?"`
4. Review logs in `/logs/` directory for detailed debugging

## Error Recovery

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Proxy server not starting**:
- Check ports 3457-3464 are free
- Verify OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set
- Look for startup detection issues (should see "proxy running on http://")

**Model failures**:
- Minimum 2 models must respond for consensus
- System gracefully degrades with fallback logic
- Check retry handler logs for detailed failure analysis
- Check `/logs/debate-*.json` for detailed error info

**Security issues**:
- Generate HMAC secret: `npm run security:generate-secret`
- Test security: `npm run test:security`
- Check signature validation in logs

**Cache issues**:
- Cache auto-invalidates after 24 hours
- Manual clear: `rm -rf cache/debate-cache.json`
- Disable: Set cache size to 0 in config

**Retry failures**:
- Check retry configuration in .env
- Review retry statistics: See debate results for retry stats
- Test retry functionality: `node test-retry-functionality.js`

## Performance Optimization

### Quality Presets
- **Rapid** (3-5s): Single fast model, use for quick answers
- **Balanced** (30-60s): 3 models, default for most questions
- **Maximum** (2-5min): 5 models with verification, critical decisions

### Parallel Instances
Use syntax `k1:2,k2,k3:3` to run multiple instances of same model with different seeds for enhanced diversity.

## Telemetry & Privacy

- Anonymous usage statistics help improve the system
- **Opt-out**: Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in `.env`
- No user questions or responses are collected
- Only collects: category, models used, timing, confidence scores
- See TELEMETRY.md for full details
