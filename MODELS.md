# Model Selection Rationale

## Why These Specific Models?

### k1: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Why**: Latest Claude model, superior to Opus in most benchmarks
- **Strengths**: Architecture, system design, code structure
- **Cost**: ~$3/M tokens input, $15/M output
- **Better than**: Claude Opus, GPT-4 for architecture

### k2: GPT-4o (October 2024)
- **Why**: OpenAI's flagship, best for comprehensive analysis
- **Strengths**: Testing strategies, security analysis, edge cases
- **Cost**: ~$2.50/M tokens
- **Better than**: GPT-4-turbo, Claude for testing scenarios

### k3: Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B Instruct
- **Why**: Beats GPT-4 on HumanEval, MBPP coding benchmarks
- **Strengths**: Pure code generation, algorithm optimization
- **Cost**: ~$0.18/M tokens (incredibly cheap for performance!)
- **Better than**: GPT-4, Sonnet for raw coding tasks

### k4: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (Dec 2024)
- **Why**: Google's latest with built-in reasoning chains
- **Strengths**: Logic verification, problem decomposition
- **Cost**: Free tier available, then ~$0.15/M tokens
- **Better than**: Gemini Pro, o1-preview for reasoning

## Why NOT These Models?

### ❌ Kimi K2
- Good model but not best-in-class for any specific task
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet is better for architecture
- GPT-4o is better for analysis

### ❌ DeepSeek Coder
- Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B consistently outperforms it
- Less reliable on OpenRouter

### ❌ o1-preview/o1-mini
- Too expensive for debate consensus
- Gemini 2.0 Thinking provides similar reasoning cheaper

### ❌ Older Claude models (Opus, Haiku)
- Sonnet 3.5 is newer and better
- You already have Opus as c1 for synthesis

## Benchmark Comparisons

### Coding (HumanEval)
1. Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B: 92.8%
2. GPT-4o: 90.2%
3. Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 88.7%
4. DeepSeek Coder: 84.1%

### Architecture & Design
1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Best
2. GPT-4o: Excellent
3. Opus: Very Good
4. Others: Good

### Testing & Analysis
1. GPT-4o: Most comprehensive
2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Excellent
3. Gemini 2.0: Good with reasoning
4. Qwen: Focused on code only

## Cost-Performance Analysis

For a typical debate (4 models, ~10K tokens each):

**Premium Tier (~$0.50-1.00 per debate)**
- k1 (Sonnet) + k2 (GPT-4o)

**Value Tier (~$0.02-0.05 per debate)**
- k3 (Qwen) + k4 (Gemini free/cheap)

**Total: ~$0.50-1.50 per complete debate**
- Worth it for critical architecture decisions
- Much cheaper than human review
- Gets consensus from best models

## OpenRouter Advantages

All models available through single API:
- Auto-routing to fastest provider
- Fallback if one provider is down
- Single billing, single API key
- No need for 4 different accounts

## Configuration Priority

If you want to optimize differently:

### For Speed
```bash
k1 = Gemini Flash (fastest)
k2 = Mixtral (fast)
k3 = Qwen (fast on OpenRouter)
k4 = Llama 3.1 70B (fast)
```

### For Cost
```bash
k1 = Gemini Flash (free tier)
k2 = Mixtral ($0.24/M)
k3 = Qwen ($0.18/M)
k4 = DeepSeek ($0.14/M)
```

### For Maximum Quality (current config)
```bash
k1 = Claude 3.5 Sonnet
k2 = GPT-4o
k3 = Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B
k4 = Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking
```
