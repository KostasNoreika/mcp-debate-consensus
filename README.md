# AI Expert Consensus v2 - MCP Server

**A revolutionary approach to AI problem-solving through intelligent multi-model consensus with advanced learning, caching, and confidence scoring capabilities.**

üÜï **Version 2.0** - Major upgrade with 9 groundbreaking features for production-ready AI consensus!

## üéØ Why This Matters

Traditional single-model AI approaches have inherent limitations - biases, knowledge gaps, and singular perspectives. This MCP server solves these issues by orchestrating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs in structured debates, where each model brings unique expertise and has **full access to development tools** through Claude CLI integration.

### Key Differentiators

- **üß† Intelligent Model Selection**: Gemini-powered coordinator automatically selects optimal models based on question analysis
- **üìä Performance Tracking**: SQLite-based tracking across 70+ universal categories (not just programming)
- **‚ö° Parallel Processing**: Support for multiple instances per model (e.g., `k1:2,k2:3` for parallel analysis)
- **üîí Cross-Verification**: Adversarial testing for critical scenarios (security, finance, legal)
- **üìà Learning System**: Continuous improvement through pattern analysis and outcome tracking
- **üíØ Confidence Scoring**: 0-100% scores with detailed breakdowns and recommendations
- **üí∞ Smart Caching**: 90% cost reduction on repeated questions with intelligent invalidation
- **üì° Real-time Streaming**: Progressive updates showing debate progress and interim results
- **üéØ Quality Presets**: Rapid/Balanced/Maximum modes for speed vs quality trade-offs
- **üîß Full MCP Access**: Each model can read files, execute commands, search codebases, and more

cd mcp-debate-consensus && npm install

# 2. Configure API key (REQUIRED!)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenRouter API key

# 3. Run automated setup
node install.js

# 4. Start the proxy server (REQUIRED before using!)
node k-proxy-server.js &

### Core Components

1. **MCP Server (`index.js`)**
   - Implements Model Context Protocol specification
   - Handles tool registration and request routing
   - Manages security and rate limiting

2. **Claude CLI Orchestrator (`src/claude-cli-debate.js`)**
   - Spawns actual Claude CLI processes for each model
   - Manages inter-model communication
   - Coordinates debate rounds and synthesis

3. **Proxy Server (`k-proxy-server.js`)**
   - Routes k1-k4 aliases to different models via OpenRouter
   - Enables model diversity while using Claude CLI interface
   - Handles API authentication and request forwarding

4. **Security Layer (`src/security.js`)**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - API key protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Path traversal prevention

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd claude-router && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Configure API key (required locally):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenRouter API key
   # This file is git-ignored for security
   ```

   ```

5. **Run health check:**
   ```bash
   node health-check.js
   ```

</details>

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLAUDE_CLI_PATH=/path/to/claude   # Optional: override auto-detection
PROXY_PORT=3456                   # Optional: base port for proxy servers
DEBATE_TIMEOUT=1800000            # Optional: max debate time (30 min default)
MIN_MODELS_REQUIRED=2             # Optional: minimum models for consensus
```

#### Claude CLI Auto-Detection

The system **automatically finds** Claude CLI without any configuration:

1. **Global command**: `claude` (if available in PATH)  
2. **Local installation**: `$HOME/.claude/local/claude`
3. **System installation**: `/usr/local/bin/claude`

**No setup required** - just install Claude CLI and it will be found automatically.

**Optional override** (only if auto-detection fails):

```bash
export CLAUDE_CLI_PATH="/custom/path/to/claude"
# or add to .env file
echo "CLAUDE_CLI_PATH=/custom/path/to/claude" >> .env
```

### MCP Integration

Add to your `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "debate-consensus": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-debate-consensus/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä How Scoring Works

The semantic scoring algorithm evaluates each proposal:

- **Relevance (40%)**: How well the answer addresses the question
- **Novelty (20%)**: Unique insights and creative approaches  
- **Quality (20%)**: Technical accuracy and completeness
- **Coherence (20%)**: Logical structure and clarity

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run health check
node health-check.js

# Test basic functionality
npm test

# Test debate with custom question
node test-debate.js "Your question here"

# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:all
```

## üîí Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **API Key Protection**: Keys never exposed in logs or outputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and excessive API usage
- **Path Restrictions**: Prevents access to system directories
- **Secure Communication**: All model communication encrypted

## üö¶ Health Monitoring

The built-in health check verifies:

- ‚úÖ Node.js version compatibility
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Environment properly configured
- ‚úÖ Proxy servers running
- ‚úÖ Claude CLI available
- ‚úÖ API connection working

Run: `node health-check.js`

## üìà Performance

- **Parallel Processing**: Models analyze independently in Round 1
- **Efficient Caching**: Responses cached to reduce API calls
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts prevent hanging
- **Resource Optimization**: Automatic cleanup of old logs
