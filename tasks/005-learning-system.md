# Task 005: Learning System for Continuous Improvement

## Current State (NOW)
- No learning from past performance
- Same model selection every time
- No optimization over time
- Static system that doesn't improve

## Future State (AFTER)
- Learns which models excel at what
- Dynamically adjusts model selection
- Tracks performance trends
- Continuously improves accuracy and efficiency

## Implementation

### Model Profiling
```javascript
class ModelProfiler {
  profiles = {
    k1: {
      strengths: ['analysis', 'education', 'writing'],
      weaknesses: ['speed', 'cost'],
      winRate: { 'tech/debug': 0.3, 'education/explain': 0.8 }
    },
    k5: {
      strengths: ['speed', 'debugging', 'cost'],
      weaknesses: ['complex_analysis'],
      winRate: { 'tech/debug': 0.7, 'education/explain': 0.2 }
    }
  };

  async updateAfterDebate(result) {
    // Update win rates
    // Identify emerging patterns
    // Adjust strengths/weaknesses
  }
}
```

### Automatic Optimization
```javascript
class LearningOptimizer {
  async optimizeSelection(category) {
    // After 50+ debates in category
    const history = await getHistory(category);

    // Find best 3-model combination
    const combinations = generateCombinations(models, 3);
    const scores = combinations.map(c =>
      calculateScore(c, history)
    );

    return combinations[maxIndex(scores)];
  }
}
```

### Pattern Detection
```javascript
async detectPatterns() {
  // Find surprising wins
  const underdogs = await findUnderdogWins();

  // Find consistent failures
  const failures = await findConsistentFailures();

  // Detect category specialists
  const specialists = await findSpecialists();

  // Adjust future selections
  await updateSelectionRules({
    underdogs, failures, specialists
  });
}
```

## Learning Milestones

### After 10 debates
- Basic category detection working
- Initial model preferences

### After 50 debates
- Reliable model selection per category
- Cost optimization active

### After 100 debates
- Full pattern recognition
- Specialist models identified
- 30-50% cost reduction

### After 500 debates
- Highly optimized selection
- Predictive performance
- New model integration easy

## Example Learning
```
Category: tech/debugging
- Debates: 47
- Best performer: k5 (65% win rate)
- Optimal combo: [k5, k2, k3]
- Avg time saved: 40%
- Cost saved: 60%
```

## Benefits
- **Continuous improvement** without code changes
- **Automatic optimization** based on real data
- **Cost reduction** through smart selection
- **Better accuracy** over time
