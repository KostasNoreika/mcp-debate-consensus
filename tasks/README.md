# AI Expert Consensus - Improvement Tasks

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Transformation Overview

**From:** Simple debate system where all 5 models always run for every question
**To:** Intelligent, learning system that optimizes model selection, costs, and quality

## ðŸ“‹ Task List

### Core Intelligence
1. **[001-intelligent-model-selection.md](001-intelligent-model-selection.md)**
   - Gemini (k4) becomes the coordinator
   - Analyzes questions and selects 3-5 optimal models
   - Reduces costs by 50% on simple tasks

2. **[002-performance-tracking-database.md](002-performance-tracking-database.md)**
   - SQLite database tracking every debate
   - 70+ universal categories (not just programming!)
   - Builds model performance profiles

3. **[005-learning-system.md](005-learning-system.md)**
   - Learns which models excel at what
   - Continuous improvement without code changes
   - 30-50% cost reduction after 100+ debates

### Quality & Verification
4. **[003-parallel-instance-support.md](003-parallel-instance-support.md)**
   - Run multiple instances: `k1:2` for critical tasks
   - Different temperatures/seeds for variety
   - Higher confidence through redundancy

5. **[004-cross-verification-system.md](004-cross-verification-system.md)**
   - Models actively find errors in each other's work
   - Code execution verification
   - Confidence scores (0-100%)

6. **[006-confidence-scoring.md](006-confidence-scoring.md)**
   - Shows when to trust the output
   - Multiple confidence factors
   - Clear thresholds for decision making

### Performance & UX
7. **[007-caching-system.md](007-caching-system.md)**
   - Cache identical questions
   - 90% cost reduction on repeated queries
   - Smart cache invalidation

8. **[008-streaming-responses.md](008-streaming-responses.md)**
   - See models thinking in real-time
   - Progressive loading
   - Better user experience

9. **[009-quality-presets.md](009-quality-presets.md)**
   - Choose: Rapid, Balanced, Maximum Accuracy
   - Automatic preset selection
   - Control speed/cost/quality balance

## ðŸš€ Implementation Phases

- [ ] Task 008: Streaming responses

## ðŸ’¡ Key Innovation: Gemini as Coordinator

Instead of blindly using all 5 models, Gemini (k4) acts as the intelligent coordinator:

```javascript
// Before: All models always run
models = ['k1', 'k2', 'k3', 'k4', 'k5'];

// After: Gemini selects optimal models
const analysis = await gemini.analyze(question);
models = gemini.selectModels(analysis);
// Might return: ['k5'] for simple debug
// Or: ['k1:2', 'k2:2', 'k3', 'k4', 'k5'] for critical code
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results After Implementation

### Cost Savings
- Simple questions: 80% cheaper (1 model vs 5)
- Medium complexity: 40% cheaper (3 models vs 5)
- Cached questions: 95% cheaper

### Speed Improvements
- Simple questions: 10x faster (3-5s vs 30-60s)
- Cached questions: 100x faster (0.1s vs 30s)
- Streaming: Better perceived speed

### Quality Improvements
- 15% higher accuracy through specialization
- Measurable confidence scores
- Fewer errors through verification

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Vision

The system becomes an intelligent, self-improving AI orchestrator that:
- Knows which experts to consult for each question
- Learns and improves from every interaction
- Provides transparency about its confidence
- Optimizes for cost, speed, or quality as needed
- Can integrate new models seamlessly

**Transformation:** From a static debate system to an intelligent AI expert panel that gets smarter with every use.
